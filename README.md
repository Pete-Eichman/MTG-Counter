#Intro
Magic The Gathering™ is a tabletop card-game that I have played since my childhood. In the game, players have many numbers to keep track of (life-totals, counters, etc.). However, using paper is wasteful, and players don't always have enough dice or counters on-hand.

MTG-Counter is designed to allow Magic The Gathering™ players to keep track of not just their life-totals, but various forms of counters as well.

MTG-Counter is written in React and uses Webpack.

#Set Up
Run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ webpack-dev-server
```

Then visit localhost:8080
